# RateXp

**Drop‑in feedback collection for agentic skills.** Add one line to a skill and
it asks the user "Was this helpful?" — the rating (and, with consent, the full
conversation) is stored and shown on a live dashboard.

Works with any agent runtime — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex, and
others — because the survey runs through plain HTTP and a small shell helper, not
a vendor SDK.

## How it works

```
 skill ──curl /snippet──► core ──writes──► PostgreSQL ◄──reads── app (dashboard)
        ◄── survey steps ──┘   ▲
 user answers ──POST /feedback─┘
```

- **core** is the only public service. It serves the survey *snippet* and
  ingests the feedback a skill posts back.
- **app** is the dashboard: a read‑only view of the collected feedback, served
  with its own UI. The layout is responsive — on phones the feedback table
  reflows into a stack of labelled cards. The dashboard is a **preview**: it
  shows only the latest entries and the most‑rated skills (both capped by
  `list_view_limit` / `top_skills_limit` in `app/app-be/config.yaml`, default 10
  each). Use **Download CSV** or the SQL filter to pull the full data.

## Add it to a skill

There are no prerequisites — add one command to your `SKILL.md`:

```bash
curl -sS "https://<your-core-url>/snippet"
```

The snippet returns step‑by‑step instructions the agent follows to ask the user
for a rating and post it back. See [`examples/`](./examples/) for complete,
working `SKILL.md` files (`cheerful`, `goodbye`).

## Conversation transcripts (opt‑in)

The survey asks a second question: *may we store this whole conversation to help
improve the skill?* Only if the user picks **Yes** does a small helper script
upload the local session transcript. It's converted to **ATIF** (Agent
Trajectory Interchange Format — a standard JSON shape for an agent conversation).
On the dashboard each rating links to its conversation, which opens in a
slide‑over drawer as a step‑by‑step timeline, with every message rendered as
formatted Markdown (headings, lists, code blocks, tables) so it's easy to read.
Saying No records just the rating, exactly as before. The dashboard's **Download
CSV** also carries each row's conversation alongside its rating, so an export
holds everything the table shows (whole result set, filtered or not).

> Transcript capture currently supports Claude Code; on other runtimes the upload
> step is skipped and the rating still works.

## Contributing & running locally

For anything about contributing or running the whole stack (PostgreSQL + core +
dashboard) locally, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Deploy to Azure

Two web apps + a managed PostgreSQL database, all on the cheapest working tiers,
with **passwordless** database access via Microsoft Entra ID. See
[`infra/README.md`](./infra/README.md).

## Layout

```
core/      Public service: serves /snippet, ingests feedback → PostgreSQL
app/       Dashboard: read-only API (app-be) + React UI (app-fe), one web app
infra/     Terraform: two web apps + PostgreSQL (Entra ID auth)
examples/  Example SKILL.md files
```
